# Day Planner

## Description

This project is a day planner, where the user can put in meetings and write a schedule for the day. It will need to display the current date, and the schedule blocks need to change color depending on the current hour. Hours will turn yellow if they are past, green for the present hour, and grey for future hours. It will also need to save the users plans with the save button, and redisplay them when the page is refreshed.

While working on this project, I've learned a lot about dayjs, as well as for loops, arrays, and localStorage.
