# Day Planner

## Description

This project is a day planner, where the user can put in meetings and write a schedule for the day. It will need to display the current date, and the schedule blocks need to change color depending on the current hour. It will also need to save the users plans with the save button.

While working on this project, I've learned a lot about dayjs, as well as for loops, arrays, and localStorage.
